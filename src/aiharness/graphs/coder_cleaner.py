"""Coder->Cleaner graph: a fixed linear LangGraph pipeline.

Orchestrates the two agents (coder -> cleaner) as a LangGraph ``StateGraph``:
``START -> coder -> cleaner -> END``. The graph is the composition seam: it wires
the standalone coder/cleaner library nodes together and never holds business
logic.

For offline testing, ``coder_chat`` / ``cleaner_chat`` inject stubbed chat
functions so no network/credentials are needed.
